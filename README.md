# Intro
### What is Unity ML?<br/>
**The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit** (ML-Agents) is an open-source
Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for
training intelligent agents. Agents can be trained using **reinforcement learning**,
**imitation learning**, **neuroevolution**, or other machine learning methods through a
simple-to-use Python API.<br/>
### What is reinforcement learning?<br/>
[Background: Machine Learning](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Background-Machine-Learning.md)

The goal of reinforcement learning is to learn a **policy**,
which is essentially a mapping from **observations** to **actions**. An
observation is what the robot can measure from its **environment** and an action, in its most raw form, is a change
to the configuration of the robot. The last remaining piece of the reinforcement learning task is the **reward
signal**. When training a robot to be a mean firefighting machine, we provide it
with rewards (positive and negative) indicating how well it is doing on
completing the task.
