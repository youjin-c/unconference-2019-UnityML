# Intro
### What is Unity ML?<br/>
**The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit** (ML-Agents) is an open-source
Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for
training intelligent agents. Agents can be trained using **reinforcement learning**,
**imitation learning**, **neuroevolution**, or other machine learning methods through a
simple-to-use Python API.<br/>
